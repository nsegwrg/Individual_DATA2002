# Individual_DATA2002
An individual assignment that uses data collected from a survey to submit findings using Hypotheses Tests. The main code is in Fin.qmd kindly render 
that file to be able to access the final product.

The main theme of this particular project is: University life. Below is the summary of the main findings.


Task approach and anxiety are independent of each other for this sample of DATA20X2 students.
There is no difference between the distributions of WAM in the high vs low sleep groups for this sample of DATA20X2 students.
There is no difference in the weighted average marks (WAM) between students with a high weekly food budget and students with a low weekly food budget for this sample of DATA20X2 students.
The data should have been a proper random sample.
Results might differ with more data points.
It seems that there is no significant effect of the access to food and the number of hours a student sleeps on their WAM or a studentâ€™s task approach on their mental health for this particular sample of DATA20X2 students.
